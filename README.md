Heya, my implementation of the pngme project (https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/chapter_1.html), putting forward message encoding and decoding to/from PNG files. 

Type  `cargo run X --help` for more details about each of the main following commands the tool proposes:

-`encode`

-`decode`

-`print`

-`remove`


Have fun with PNGs!
